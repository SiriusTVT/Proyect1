## Project Description  
This project was developed for the course **Sistemas de Interacción - Miniproject 1**.  
The objective was to take the official trailer of **Resident Evil** (upcoming game/movie) and completely change its meaning by editing only the audio using **Audacity**, while keeping the original video intact.  

The original trailer had a horror atmosphere. Our goal was to reinterpret it into a **comedic version** by replacing the suspenseful and frightening sounds with humorous audio effects.  

## What We Did  
1. Extracted the audio track from the Resident Evil trailer.  
2. Created a new base track to set a lighter and funnier tone.  
3. Synchronized the new track with the original video to keep the same length and timing.  
4. Added different sound effects and comedic inserts to reinforce the new meaning:  
   - *“Juguemos un juego” parody from EnchufeTV* → used for humorous emphasis.  
   - *Typical audience laugh track* → to replace scary silence with funny moments.  
   - *“Awwwww” sound effect* → to turn tense moments into something cute.  
   - *“Ummm yeahhh” effect* → to break the horror atmosphere.  
5. Ensured the final trailer length matched the original (respecting project requirements).  
6. Exported the edited audio and replaced the original trailer audio using video editing software.  

## Justification  
We decided to transform the trailer from horror into comedy because it creates a clear and noticeable contrast. The choice of laugh tracks, parody sounds, and exaggerated reactions changes the perception of the trailer entirely, making it impossible to feel fear while watching it.  

This approach also allowed us to experiment with different Audacity tools:  
- **Cutting and arranging** audio segments.  
- **Adjusting volume levels** to synchronize with the video.  
- **Timing effects** to match laughs and reactions with specific trailer scenes.  
- **Inserting external sound effects** to replace original horror sounds.  

By applying these edits, the trailer shifts from a terrifying experience into a parody-like comedy sketch.
